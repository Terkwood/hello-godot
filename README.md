# Hello Godot

An almost exact copy of the [instancing demo for Godot engine](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/step_by_step/instancing.html#instancing).

Exported to HTML5 with the addition of touch.  Should render
nicely on _some_ mobile devices.

## Live Demo

You can [play with the live demo](https://princess.terkwood.farm).
